This project aims to analyze and predict cancer risk by examining various lifestyle factors such as age, gender, air pollution exposure, smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and other related attributes. Given the increasing impact of lifestyle on health, particularly in relation to cancer, this solution provides individuals with an estimated risk score based on their personal habits and environment. By identifying key risk factors such as wheezing, chest pain, coughing, dust allergies, and occupational hazards, the model aims to support early detection and prevention strategies. The dataset used includes a range of patient features, and machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are utilized for prediction. Data preprocessing, visualization, and correlation analysis help identify the most influential risk factors. The model was developed using Python libraries including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, scikit-learn for machine learning model building, and warnings to manage runtime warnings. The system enables users to assess their risk and make informed lifestyle decisions to reduce their likelihood of developing cancer.
